## Summary
- Analyzing number of concepts by clusters in each algorithm
- Creating table of concpets by clusters over the threshold(n>25) in each algorithm
- Creating a proposal of benefits of clustering

## Hypothesis: Benefits of clustering
- Determining the class of "NA" concepts
- Defining new class & sub-class of existing classes
- Recommending alternative classes for concepts
